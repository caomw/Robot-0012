\section{Introduction}

"Kidnapped the robot" is a test problem used commonly in the mobile robotics field. This test determine how accurate a robot can estimate its position given a map, random start point and a target destination, then the robot using sensors have to measure its environment and calculates its position. 

This report will cover how we attacked this problem and how we solved it. It is divided in [add number of sections]. It will first cover the design and assembly of the robot. It will then describe our solution to the localisation, navigation and path planning. The third part provide the results obtained from both, the simulation and the real robot. Finally, some discussion about the difference between simulation and the real robot found while conducting our test.
