\section*{Introduction}

``Kidnapped robot'' is a mobile robot localisation and navigation problem, where the goal is to estimate the location of the kidnapped robot within a known map and navigate it to a desired target position. This project aims to design an effective and efficient method to tackle this problem. To achieve the aim, this project was first conducted in a simulated environment in MATLAB and then the proposed method was applied to a real robot, which is a Lego NXT robot. The challenges of this project are: first, the only sensor used to help detect the environment is an imperfect ultrasonic sensor, which means the sensor readings are influenced by noises; second, the robot needs to explore an optimal path toward the target with less distance; third, the robot is required to be safely navigated to the target without any collision into walls.

This report presents the method we proposed to solve the ``Kidnapped robot'' problem. The structure of this report is organised as follows: in section \ref{sec:robot} we introduce the configuration of our Lego robot and the sensor calibration; in section \ref{sec:method} we describe our proposed method; the experimental results are illustrated in section \ref{sec:result}; a discussion summarising this project is given in section \ref{sec:discuss}.
