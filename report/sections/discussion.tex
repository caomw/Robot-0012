We achieved the objectives of designing and modelling a mobile robot, implementing a particle-filters algorithm for addresing the kidnapping robot problem and implementing an A* graph search algorithm for navigating the robot towards a goal. On the design stage, we addressed the challenges on how to build the robot for navigating  'smoothly' on a imperfect environment (not uniform floor, not continums walls, etc). We learned how to select an adequate number of particles and choose a proper number of beams for the sensor reading through simulated experiments, additionally we developed an exploring algorithm instead of a random exploration, in seeks for an accurate and fast localisation; for the robot navigation, using purely A* graph was not enough, we further developed an algorithm (i.e. map resizing) for keeping the robot as being centered as possible within the map.
