We achieved the objectives of designing and modelling a mobile robot, implementing a particle-filters algorithm for addresing the kidnapping robot problem and implementing an A* graph search algorithm for navigate the robot towards a goal. On the design stage, we addressed the challenges on how to build the robot for navigating  'smoothly' on a non perfect environment (not uniform floor, not continums walls, etc). We learned how to select an adequate number of particles and choosing a proper number of beams for the sensor reading trough simulated experiments, additionally we develop an exploring algorithm instead of a random exploration, in seeks for an accurate and fast localisation; for the robot navigation, using purely A* graph was not enough, we developed an algorithm for keeping the robot as centered a possible within the map.

The difference between the simulation and the real robot
